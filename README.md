# DayFinderPython
In This program you input a year, a day, and a month, this will find what day it is and that is about it. Not much to using this program.
I made this program a very long time ago but when I got a new computer I lost the file, so I decided to make it again, 
when i remember making it was a lot harder. But thats cause I didn't have the algorithm for making it already in my head.
So the way this works is pretty simple, it multiplies the year you entered - 2 by 365.4322222 or something. Then it takes the month you entered
and adds up all the days from each month to the month you put in. Then it when it gets to the last one it stops, and adds the day you entered.
Then once all of that lame stuff is done, it goes to the clever equation i thot of. I thot it was really cool a long time ago and still think
it is so yeah.
Basically it is this.
Totaldays % 7 = the day the date is on. This is because when you mod it by 7 you have a remainder so say you have 11 that mod 7 = 4
that means in 11 days, it will be 4 days from the day you are on now. Try it, it works.
 
 That is the way I did this so yep. HAVE FUN!
